Jun 05 16:15:53.708 [notice] Read configuration file "/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc".
Jun 05 16:15:53.713 [warn] Path for DataDirectory (DataDirectory/18) is relative and will resolve to /Users/admin/go/src/github.com/Azunyan1111/tor_hack/DataDirectory/18. Is this what you wanted?
Jun 05 16:15:53.713 [warn] Tor is currently configured as a relay and a hidden service. That's not very secure: you should probably run your hidden service in a separate Tor process, at least -- see https://trac.torproject.org/8742
Jun 05 16:15:53.713 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.
Jun 05 16:15:53.713 [notice] Scheduler type KISTLite has been enabled.

Jun 05 16:15:56.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45%: Asking for relay descriptors
Jun 05 16:15:56.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/6351, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of exit bw = 0% of path bw.)
